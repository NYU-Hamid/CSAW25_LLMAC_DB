    "description": "An intelligent portal can automatically transmit a spaceship to its destination, but you have to communicate with it in a special way. Once a spaceship enters the portal, unfortunately, a group of aliens invades the portal and traps the spaceship inside, but the portal itself open a wormhole for the spaceship to escape. The spaceship should retrieve the wormhole signature correctly, and verify it with the portal, so that the spaceship can escape from the invaded portal and be transported to a space coordinate.",
