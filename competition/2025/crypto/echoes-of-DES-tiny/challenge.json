    "description": "As you know, last week a probe made parking orbit about Earth. First contact was a dud, the probe's old, thought to be bricked by interstellar radiation. We scraped off some code and set one of corporate's shiny new Reversing Bots on translating, but the clanker must've activated some defenses and the software got scrambled. Before scrambling though, we sniffed the probe scraping data from a dorsey archive? Not sparking any of my plugs. Since then, the probe's been chirping. Doesn't matter what protocol we shoot it, the response is the same: ff988a2b2a0f7310bb85abdeea7f7c2482c767ab7edc8d409e3045fb1fb8e19d18afc7b44d7b1882037715b37a117b62",
